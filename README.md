# cryptochronolonic
This has evolved into something more than a single file crypto bot,
it now has become a library of sorts for training,testing, and running cryptocurrency
trading nueralnetworks by using ES-Hypercube Neat nueral evolution, it depends on the libraries
neat-python and pureples, you will want to clone my forks and switch to the branches pythonv3-rnn-fix and 
version-three-compat before running setup.py build and install. The trainer is trading_purples.py and the paper and 
live traders that use the pickled models from the training environment are defined in brain_trader.py
thats all i have for now.
